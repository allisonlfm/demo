<p> 2. What are local files, what are web servers, what is FTP and how are they related? </p>
<p> <ul> Local files are files saved to your own personal computer, such as a design for a website. Web servers are places that host websites. In order to publish your website design (for example, but it can be any other local file), you need to use FTP, or file transfer protocol, to upload the files to the web server. FTP acts as the highway between the private and the public domains on the Internet. </ul> </p>
