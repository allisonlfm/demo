<p> 1. What are the three basic technologies needed to run a website? </p>
	<p> In order to run a website, you need a web hosting space, FTP (file transfer protocol) and AFS. </p>

<p> 2. What are local files, what are web servers, what is FTP and how are they related? </p>
	<p> Local files are files saved to your own personal computer, such as a design for a website. Web servers are places that host websites. In order to publish your website design (for example, but it can be any other local file), you need to use FTP, or file transfer protocol, to upload the files to the web server. FTP acts as the highway between the private and the public domains on the Internet. </p>

<p> 3. What is AFS Space and what does it allow you to do? </p>
	<p> AFS Space is a file storage system that allows you to store your files and publish them to a website, such as the MSU Netfiles system. </p>

<p> 4. What is the URL for the web space MSU provides for you in your AFS space? </p>
	<p> My URL for the web space MSU provides for me is http://www.msu.edu/~marinoa1. </p>
