<p> 1. Identify	at least one instance of the four CRAP principles on the site? </p>
<p> <ul> C (Contrast):	Her	general	layout	is	simple,	yet	noticeable.	The	lovely	purple	shade	
reflects her desire	to stand out, while not being too ostentatious. </ul> </p>
<p> <ul> R (Repetition): The font style	and	sizing remains constant	throughout the site. Overall, the layout is	the	same across	pages, while using	her	sense	of	humor	to	liven	
things up. </ul> </p>
<p> <ul> A (Alignment):	The	layout is very neat, with clean	lines. Each	page is	nicely designed, albeit	very simply	designed. </ul> </p>
<p> <ul> P (Proximity):	Eyes are drawn	to	pictures on	the	side first,	rather than	actual written descriptions. Pictures are large, and detract from the original purpose – the written work. </ul> <p>
<div> </div>
<p> 2.	Choose one aspect of the site’s graphic design that you find visually appealing. Analyze this using CRAP – why is it pleasing? What choices did the designer make that make it pleasing? </p>
<p> <ul> Teagan’s homepage very much shows off her personality. It is witty and easy to read, while also being pleasing to the eye. </ul> </p>
<p> <ul> C: The layout consists of a large picture of her as a child, with general fun facts about her written to the right of it. The purple, black and white colors used stand out without being annoying. </ul> </p>
<p> <ul> R: She uses the same font across the board, with links to things relating to her fun facts (ex. a recipe for hummus because she loves hummus) in the same purple as her background. All other writing is in black. </ul> </p>
<p> <ul> A: There are very clean lines on this page, and the reader doesn’t have to scroll all around to learn about Teagan. </ul> </p>
<p> <ul> P: The large picture relates to her writing on the page without being too annoying and distracting. </ul> </p>
<div> </div>
<p> 3.	Choose one aspect of the site’s graphic design that you find least appealing, and discuss how the designer could use CRAP principles to improve it. </p>
<p> <ul> Teagan’s page entitled “Writing” which showcases her writing samples could use some work. </p> </ul>
<p> <ul> C: The contrast isn’t much different from the other pages, but there is an awkward usage of bolded and non-bolded texts plus different sizes. </p> </ul>
<p> <ul> R: There are no repeating patterns besides the font, which as mentioned before, varies between different styles of the same font. </p> </ul>
<p> <ul> A: The layout is choppy and not very clean. The lines are not very defined, and it continues on longer. </p> </ul>
<p> <ul> P: There is awkward spacing between different portions of this page and it is distracting form the true content – her writing. </p> </ul>
<div> </div>
<p> 4.	If you were to replicate or mimic one aspect of your alum’s design on your own portfolio, what would it be and why? </p>
<p> <ul> I love the personal feel of this portfolio because it really helps me to get to know Teagan’s work and how she relates to it. I would want to make my own portfolio feel just as personal and have people who read it get to know me. </p> </ul>
